# Creating Action Templates

To create and publish your own action templates, simply follow the steps below.

### 1. Fork this repository ‚úÖ

### 2. Create a branch for your template ‚úÖ

`git checkout -b feature/utilities/your-template-name`

### 3. Copy the boilerplate folder into the proper directory ‚úÖ

Copy the `/sample` folder into the respective location within the `/catalog` folder.

Each template folder is grouped in a parent directory that relates to its platform. For example, the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a> action to create an SMS message should be stored in the following path structure:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ catalog/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ twilio/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create-message/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
|           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input.js
|           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run.js
```

General templates that do not fall under the category of any vendor should be added under `catalog/utilities/`.

### 4. Update the `config.json` file ‚úÖ

The `config.json` file contains all the settings for your template. Below are the descriptions for each configuration parameter.

### 5. Update the `input.js` file ‚úÖ

Update your `input.js` file to set the input values that will be passed into your run function. Read more about the `input` function in our [docs](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows).

A sample [input.js](/sample/input.js) file is visible inside the `actions/sample/` directory.

### 6. Update the `run.js` file ‚úÖ

Write your template's main logic within the `run.js` file. Read more about the `run` function in our [docs](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows).

A sample [run.js](/sample/run.js) file is visible inside the `actions/sample/` directory.

### 7. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file ‚úÖ

You'll notice that each template folder contains a `CHANGELOG.md` file. When creating a template, ensure that you've also copied this file over from the `actions/sample/` folder. 

Update the sample [CHANGELOG.md](/sample/CHANGELOG.md) file to reflect the appropriate information about your template.

### 8. Create a pull request ‚úÖ

Once you've tested and finished your Action Template, create a pull request on the `development` branch of this repository from your forked repository's branch. Once approved and merged to main, your Action Template will be live on Buildable, for the entire community!

### Testing your code üí°

To test your templates, you can write your logic within an Action template in a [Buildable Workflow](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows) to ensure everything works as expected.

### Code formatting

To format the code structure of the templates, simply run:

```
npm run prettier
```

### Tracking changes üìù

All updates to any template should be carefully documented in this file, following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) structure and adhering to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

### Creating your own private templates (BETA) ü§´

If you'd like to create private templates that are only accessible in your Buildable account, you can do so by publishing privately. This feature is currently still in Beta so if you'd like access, send us a request by emailing `friends@buildable.dev` for a private publishing token.
